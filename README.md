# **OD20480C Lab Project: Contoso Conference Application**

## **Lab 01: Exploring the Contoso Conference Application**

#### **Scenario**
ContosoConf is an annual technical conference that describes the latest tools and techniques for building HTML5 web applications. The conference organizers have created a website to support the conference, using the same technologies that the conference showcases.

You are a developer that creates websites by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and you have been given access to the code for the website for the latest conference. You decide to take a look at this web application to see how it works, and how the developer has used Visual Studio 2017 to create it.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Describe the structure of the Contoso Conference web application.
Use Visual Studio 2017 to examine the structure of a web application, run a web application, and modify a web application.

##### **Exercise 1: Exploring the Contoso Conference Application**
In this exercise, you will run the Contoso Conference web application and examine each of the functions it provides.
##### **Exercise 2: Examining and Modifying the Contoso Conference Application**
In this exercise, you will examine the Visual Studio 2017 project for the Contoso Conference application. You will see how the project is structured, and how the files and scripts for the project are organized into folders. You will then run the application again, make some modifications to the HTML markup and CSS, and view the results.
